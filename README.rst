This is a thin abstraction layer for interfacing with
`Aptly's HTTP API <https://www.aptly.info/doc/api/>`__. It's used by
`GoPythonGo <https://github.com/gopythongo/gopythongo/>`__, but can be used as
a standalone library from Pypi.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install aptly-api-client


Usage
-----

The library provides a direct abstraction of the published Aptly API, mostly
using the same naming, only replacing it with pythonic naming where necessary.
All code has full `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`__
annotations, so if you're using a modern IDE, using this library should be
especially straight-forward.

Where appropriate, the library exposes the interface of the underlying
``requests`` library. This allows you to configure CA pinning, SSL client
certificates, HTTP Basic authentication etc.

.. code-block:: python

    # initialize a client
    from aptly_api import Client
    aptly = Client("http://aptly-endpoint.test/")

    # create a repository
    aptly.repos.create("myrepo", comment="a test repo",
                       default_distribution="mydist",
                       default_component="main")

    # upload a package
    aptly.files.upload("test_folder", "/tmp/mypkg_1.0_amd64.deb")

    # add the package to the repo
    aptly.repos.add_uploaded_file("myrepo", "test_folder")
